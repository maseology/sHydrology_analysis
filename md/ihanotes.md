### Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA)

Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration is a suite of statistical measures used to characterize the in-stream flow regime. The means and coefficients of variation (CV) of each IHA statistics are separated into 5 groups. Test's for significant (p<0.05) change in IHAs are completed via the t-test on means and Lewontin (1996) on CVs.

#### Groups (*after* Richter et.al., 1996):

1.	**MAGNITUDE** 

	This group includes 12 parameters, each of which measures the central tendency (mean) of the daily water conditions for a given month. The monthly mean of the daily water conditions describes "normal" daily conditions for the month, and thus provides a general measure of habitat availability or suitability. The similarity of monthly means within a year reflects conditions of relative hydrologic constancy, whereas inter-annual variation (e.g., coefficient of variation) in the mean water condition for a given month provides an expression of environmental contingency (Colwell 1974; Poff & Ward 1989). The terms *constancy* and *contingency* as used here refer to the degree to which monthly means vary from month to month (constancy) and the extent to which flows vary within any given month (contingency).

2. **MAGNITUDE AND DURATION OF ANNUAL EXTREME CONDITIONS**

	The 10 parameters in this group measure the magnitude of extreme (minimum and maximum) annual water conditions of various duration, ranging from daily to seasonal. The durations we used follow natural or human-imposed cycles and include the 1-day, 3-day, 7-day (weekly), 30-day (monthly), and 90-day (seasonal) extremes. For any given year, the 1-day maximum (or minimum) is represented by the highest (or lowest) single daily value occurring during the year; the multi-day maximum (or minimum) is represented by the highest (or lowest) multi-day average value occurring during the year. The mean magnitude of high and low water extremes of various duration provide measures of environmental stress and disturbance during the year; conversely, such extremes may be necessary precursors or triggers for the reproduction of certain species. The inter-annual variation (e.g., coefficient of variation) in the magnitude of these extremes provides another expression of contingency.

3. **TIMING OF ANNUAL EXTREME CONDITIONS**

	Group 3 includes two parameters, one measuring the Julian date of the 1-day annual minimum water condition and the other measuring the Julian date of the 1-day maximum water condition. The timing of the highest and lowest water conditions within annual cycles provides another measure of environmental disturbance or stress by describing the seasonal nature of these stresses. Key life-cycle phases (e.g., reproduction) may be intimately linked to the timing of annual extremes; thus human-induced changes in timing may cause reproductive failure, stress, or mortality. The inter-annual variation in timing of extreme events reflects environmental contingency.

4. **FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF HIGH AND LOW PULSES**

	The four parameters in group 4 include two that measure the number of annual occurrences during which the magnitude of the water condition exceeds an upper threshold or remains below a lower threshold, respectively, and two that measure the mean duration of such high and low pulses. These measures of frequency and duration of high and low water conditions together portray the pulsing behavior of environmental variation within a year and provide measures of the shape of these environmental pulses. Hydrologic pulses are defined here as those periods within a year in which the daily mean water condition either rises above the 75th percentile (high pulse) or drops below the 25th percentile (low pulse) of all daily values for the preimpact time period.

5. **RATE AND FREQUENCY OF CHANGE IN CONDITIONS**

	The four parameters in group 5 measure the number and mean rate of both positive and negative changes in water conditions from one day to the next. The rate and frequency of change in water conditions can be described in terms of the abruptness and number of intra-annual cycles of environmental variation and can provide a measure of the rate and frequency of intra-annual environmental change.
