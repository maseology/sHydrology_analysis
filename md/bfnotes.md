#### Hydrograph separation methods:

 1.	**BF.LH:** The Lyne-Hollick digital filter (Lyne and Hollick, 1979), 3-pass sweep with *α=0.925* as discussed in Chapman (1999);
 2.	**BF.CM:** The Chapman-Maxwell digital filter (Chapman and Maxwell, 1996), using automatically computed recession coefficient (*k*);
 3.	**BF.BE:** The Boughton-Eckhardt digital filter (Boughton, 1993; Eckhardt, 2005) with computed *k* and *BFImax=0.8*;
 4.	**BF.JH:** The Jakeman-Hornberger digital filter (Jakeman and Hornberger, 1993) based on their IHACRES model with *C=0.3* and *α=-exp(-1/k)*;
 5.	**BF.Cl:** The 'Clarifica' method of Clarifica Inc. (2002);
 6.	**BF.UKn:** The UK Institute of Hydrology (or Wallingford) method (Institute of Hydrology, 1980), sweeping minimum of Piggott et.al. (2005);
 7.	**BF.UKx:** The UK Institute of Hydrology/Wallingford method (Institute of Hydrology, 1980), sweeping maximum of Piggott et.al. (2005);
 8.	**BF.UKm:** The UK Institute of Hydrology/Wallingford method (Institute of Hydrology, 1980), sweeping median;
 9.	**BF.HYSEP.FI:** The HYSEP fixed-interval method (Sloto and Crouse, 1996), with known catchment area;
 10.	**BF.HYSEP.SI:** The HYSEP sliding-interval method (Sloto and Crouse, 1996), with known catchment area;
 11.	**BF.HYSEP.LM:** The HYSEP local minima method (Sloto and Crouse, 1996), with known catchment area;
 12.	**BF.PART1:** The PART method (Rutledge, 1998), with known catchment area, pass 1 of 3 antecedent recession requirement;
 13.	**BF.PART2:** The PART method (Rutledge, 1998), with known catchment area, pass 2 of 3 antecedent recession requirement;
 14.	**BF.PART3:** The PART method (Rutledge, 1998), with known catchment area, pass 3 of 3 antecedent recession requirement.
