# Hydrologic regime components and associated indicators selected to assess hydrologic alteration.



| Characteristics | Indicator(s) |
|---|---|
| Baseflow | Monthly median baseflow magnitude $(\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1})$. |
| Subsistence flow | Monthly 95% exceedance flow magnitude of total streamflow $(\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1})$ (preliminary assessment). % wetted perimeter (field-based assessment) |
| High flow pulses (less than bankfull) | Monthly median frequency and duration $(\text{days})$ of flow events less than the bankfull flow magnitude |
| Channel forming flow | Magnitude $(\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1})$, duration $(\text{days})$ and timing (month) of flows with a recurrence interval of 1.5 years |
| Riparian flow | Magnitude $(\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1})$, duration $(\text{days})$ and timing (month) of flows with recurrence intervals of 2, 10, and 20 years |
| Rate of change of flow | Monthly median rate-of-change of flow $(\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1}\text{hr}^{-1})$ for rising and falling limbs of flow events. |
