#### Cumulative discharge:

Notes:

1. Black dotted line: Average watershed yield over the entire period of record.
1. Blue line: Piecewise regression (helpful in detecting breakpoints).


#### BFI plot:

A 365-day rolling average of the baseflow index determined using the median of [hydrograph separation estimates](https://owrc.github.io/info/hydrographseparation/). 

The baseflow index (BFI) is the proportion of total flow (\\(q_t\\)) composed of "baseflow" (\\(q_b\\)):

$$ \text{BFI}=\frac{\sum q_b}{\sum q_t} $$
