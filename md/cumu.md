#### Cumulative discharge:

Cumulative discharge shows the history of watershed yield relative to its average (dotted line).


#### BFI plot:

A 30-day rolling average of the baseflow index determined using the median of hydrograph separation estimates. 

The baseflow index (BFI) is the proportion of total flow (\\(q_t\\)) composed of "baseflow" (\\(q_b\\)):

$$ \text{BFI}=\frac{q_b}{q_t} $$
