#### Recession coefficient

The recession coefficient is computed automatically based on the analysis of available data. The user may `Update` the value to meet their needs. (CAUTION: updating the recession coefficient will impact hydrograph separation and event yield calculations.) 

Pressing `Reset` will re-compute the recession coefficient.
